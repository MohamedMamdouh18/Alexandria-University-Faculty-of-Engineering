The sine of x can be calculated approximately by summing the first n terms of the infinite series: of the taylor series

 (x in radians)

Write a program that will read in a value for x (in degrees) and then calculate its sine. Sum the first n terms, where n represents a positive integer that is read along with the value of x. For factorial use double or long long.

Input Format

a single line containing x and n

Constraints

double x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 360
