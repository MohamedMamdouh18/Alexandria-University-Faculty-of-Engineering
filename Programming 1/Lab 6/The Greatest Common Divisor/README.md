GCD is the greatest number that exactly divides two or more numbers with no remainder. For example, the factors of the number 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and the factors of the number 30 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30. So the GCD of 12 and 30 is 6. Write a C program that scans two numbers and calculates their GCD.
