A year with 366 days is called a leap year. A year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4 (for example, the year 1980), except it is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100 (for example, the year 1900); however, it is a leap year if it is divisible by 400 (for example, the year 2000). Write a program that scans a year y and computes whether that year is a leap year or not.

Input Format

a single integer y

Constraints

0 ≤ y ≤ 100000

Output Format

if y is a leap year print "Leap"
if y is not a leap year print "Not Leap"

Sample Input

1980
Sample Output

Leap
Explanation

1980 is divisble by 4 and not divisble by 100.
