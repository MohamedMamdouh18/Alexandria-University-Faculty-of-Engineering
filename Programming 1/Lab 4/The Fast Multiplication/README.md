When mulipling by power of two, shift operator can be faster than reqular multiplication. Given two number x and y. Return z = x ∗ pow(2, y) using shift operator. It’s guaranteed that z will fit in integer. Don't use loops or pow() or multiplication.

Input Format

Two integer x, y

Constraints

-1000 ≤ x ≤ 1000
0 ≤ y ≤ 11

Output Format

a single integer z as described above.

Sample Input

1 1
Sample Output

2
Explanation

1 * pow(2, 1) = 2
