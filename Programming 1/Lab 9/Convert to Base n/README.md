Write a program that uses a recursive method to convert an integer from base 10 to another
base. Your program should read the integer and the base as inputs. The recursive function
should print the number in the new base. So, if the inputs were:
number = 13, base = 2, then the output should be: 1101

Note: Supporting up to base 10 will get you half the bonus grade. Supporting higher bases
will get you the full mark of the bonus.
