Given an array of length N, you can do any of the following operations as many times as you want:

Erase an integer Z from the array and insert two new integers X, Y such that X + Y = Z.

Erase 2 intergers X, Y and insert new integer Z such that Z = X + Y.

What is the smallest array in size such that all its elements are powers of two and at the same time new array will still have the same sum as the old array? Just think in binary.

You must use functions to solve this problem.

Use long long to avoid overflow.

Think of a good algorithm to solve this problem!

Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T, number of test cases.

Each test case contains two lines, the first line will contain a single integer N. The second line will contain N space separated integers.

Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000

1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000000000

Output Format

For each test case print a single integer, the length of the smallest array in size and all of its elements are powers of two.
