Write a recursive function to produce a pattern of n lines of asterisks. First line has 1 asterisk,
second has 2 asterisks, up to the nth line that has n asterisks. Then, line n+1 has n-1, next
lines has n-2, and so on until line 2n-1, which has 1 asterisk. For example, for n = 4, the output
should be:

*
**
***
****
