In this problem you are required to write a program to reads 2 matrices (of dimensions N x M and M x L), multiplies them and displays the output.

Input Format

first line contians theree integers n, f, m
first matrix has dimenstions n x f
second matrix has dimenstions f x m
follows the first line the first matrix then the second matrix

Constraints

1 ≤ n, f, m ≤ 200
-1000 ≤ matrix element ≤ 1000

Output Format

print matrix of size n x m that is the result of the multiplication
